# Backwards Compatibility

-   **DO NOT maintain backwards compatibility** - Feel free to refactor, rename, or restructure code as needed
-   **ALWAYS write clean, maintainable code** - do not preserve old interfaces or patterns when a simpler option could be implemented

# Initialization and Configuration

-   **Single initialization point** - All module initialization (config parsing, database connections, etc.) must happen once and only once in the main module (e.g., `app/main.py` lifespan function)
-   **NO global accessor methods** - Do not create global accessor functions that read from environment variables or global state
-   **Pass dependencies explicitly** - Parse configuration once in the main module and pass the config object explicitly to every code path that needs it
-   **Configuration as parameter** - Functions that need configuration should accept it as a parameter rather than calling a global accessor
-   **No environment variable access in modules** - Only the main module should read environment variables; all other modules receive configuration through function/constructor parameters
