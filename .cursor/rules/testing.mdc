# Running Code Checks

Always use `uv run poe check` to run all code quality checks. This command will:

-   Run linting with ruff (auto-fixes issues)
-   Run tests with pytest
-   Run type checking with mypy

## Running Tests

Always use `uv run poe test` to run the test suite. This will:

-   Run all pytest tests in the `tests/` directory
-   Generate coverage reports (terminal, HTML, and XML)
-   Use verbose output for better visibility

## Before Committing Code

Before suggesting code changes are complete:

1. Run `uv run poe check` to ensure all checks pass
2. If checks fail, fix the issues before proceeding
3. Ensure tests pass with `uv run poe test`
4. As a last check before a commit, ensure integration tests pass with `uv run poe test-e2e`

## When Making Code Changes

-   After making code changes, verify they pass linting and type checks
-   Ensure new code includes appropriate tests
-   Run the full check suite: `uv run poe check`

## Test Configuration Files

-   **Reference examples** - Test configuration files serve as reference examples for users, so they should be complete, valid, and demonstrate proper configuration patterns
-   **Documentation** - Test configuration files should include comments explaining their purpose and any test-specific requirements
